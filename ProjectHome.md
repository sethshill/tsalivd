The tractive-system-active-light of the Formula SAE/Student Electric rules has to turn on when the voltage outside the accumulator relay exceeds 40V DC.

TSALivd allows to flash a light between 2 and 5 Hz when those conditions are met.

The boards schematics's and Eagle PCB layouts are available under the source tab, in our SVN repository.

The TSALivd logo is showing the Stuttgart GreenTeam, running at the Formula Student Germany night endurance.

**Known limitations:**

The voltage regulator which is used (Supertex LR8) is rated up to 450V.

Documentation (poster and report) is actually only available in French.
